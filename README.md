# Laptop-Stand
A laptop stand is a device that a laptop can be set on that is raised up off a table or another surface. Laptop stands can make it easier to work on and use laptops because the screen is closer to eye level and the keyboard can be at an angle instead of flat horizontally. Another benefit of using a laptop stand is the increase of airflow to the laptop. Some laptop stands also include a built-in docking station, to allow for additional connectivity to other devices.
